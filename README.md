Thank you for visiting my github for my WeightliftingTracker application!

This application was built using React.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and was hosted on heroku's servers.

This application allows me to quickly log and update my weight lifts while I am at the gym and allows me to view my progression by visiting my /progression route.
